### Learnable Task 4

This repository contains three (3) different tasks, which are assignments given by Genesys Learnable23 to test our understanding of the concepts of OOP: **Classes and Objects**.

a. **class.js**: showing a class that has class/static properties and methods and how to use/access them.

b. **descriptiveStat.js**: this code computes descriptive statistics from the three (3) measure of central tendency to the five (5) measures of dispersion

PS: I used a static methods in a class called DataSet to represent
- Mean
- Mode
- Median
- Range
- Mean Deviation
- Variance
- Standard Deviation
and
- Quartile Deviation

c. **movieApi.js**: I worked on a simple Movie renting API that lets people rent movies from a movie store. You can carry out basic functions like 
- adding a movie to the movie store
- seeing the list of movies and their availability
